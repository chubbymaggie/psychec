- Our C parser derives from the C++ parser of the Qt Creator IDE, which is copyrighted by
  Roberto Raggi - we use the parser, exclusively, not Qt Creator's compiler frontend as
  a whole. Those files are located in directory `frontend', together with our own extensions
  and components.

- The command-line processing utility, located in directory `command', is copyrighted by
  Jarryd Beck and originally from https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts.
